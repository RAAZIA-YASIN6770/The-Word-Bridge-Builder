# The-Word-Bridge-Builder
The Word-Bridge Builder: An interactive educational platformer where kids build physical bridges through spelling. Correct words create solid Steel/Diamond bridges, while errors result in fragile Paper/Glass paths that collapse. Features dynamic material feedback, 3D world themes (Space/Lava), and power-ups to make learning addictive.

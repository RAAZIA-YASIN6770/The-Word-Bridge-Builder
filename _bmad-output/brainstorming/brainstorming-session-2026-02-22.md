# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Raazia Yasin
**Date:** 2026-02-22

## Session Overview

**Topic:** The Word-Bridge Builder: Educational Spelling Platformer
**Goals:** Define core mechanics, difficulty scaling, environmental matching, and expand world themes.

### Session Setup

Initial core concept and mechanics provided by the session leader.

## Brainstorming Nodes

- **Core Concept:** A 2D/3D platformer where a character (Robot/Adventurer) builds bridges using spellings.
- **Physical Feedback Mechanism:**
    - *Correct Spelling:* Bridge transforms into Steel/Diamond (Solid & Safe).
    - *Incorrect Spelling:* Bridge becomes Paper/Glass (Collapses under the character).
- **Level Design Elements:**
    - *Easy:* Static letters, 1-2 missing.
    - *Hard:* Moving clouds, smoke/fog, many missing letters.
- **Environmental Match:** The bridge material and background must change based on the word (e.g., 'OCEAN' = Coral/Water bridge).
- **Power-ups & Hints:**
    - 'Jetpack' for speed.
    - 'Lightbulb' for picture-hints.

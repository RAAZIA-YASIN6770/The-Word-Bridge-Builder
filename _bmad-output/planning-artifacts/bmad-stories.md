## ✅ Definition of Done (DoD) for First Playable Prototype
The "First Playable" is considered done when:

1. **Functional Spelling:** A user can complete a 3-5 letter word using the tap/drag interface.
2. **Visual Feedback:** The bridge transforms into a "Solid" state (Steel) or "Fragile" state (Paper) immediately upon completion.
3. **Character Sequence:** The character attempts to walk across the resulting bridge.
4. **Win/Loss States:** The level ends with either a "Success" (crossing) or "Failure" (falling) trigger.
5. **Basic World:** At least one environment (e.g., The Forest) is rendered with basic assets.
